## How to Run

### React App
1. Go to the `react-login-app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd react-login-app
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### KnockoutJS App
1. Go to the `knockout-login-app` folder.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## My Approach
- I first built the React version using hooks and component-based architecture.
- For KnockoutJS, I mapped React’s state/props to observables and bindings, ensuring feature and UX parity.
- I used official documentation, community resources, and AI-based tools (as a guide, not for full-code generation) to learn KnockoutJS best practices.

For more details, see each project’s own README.
